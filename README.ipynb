    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of an MPC-Controller is as follows. We are given waypoints by some planning procedure (not part of this project) and the goal is to choose values for the actuators such that the car follows the desired trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we have two __actuators__, the steering angle and the throttle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similiar to the lecture, the __state__ is described by x-coordinates, y-cooridnates, the orientation $\\psi$, the velocity v, the cross track error cte, and the orientation error $e\\psi$. So, the state is 6-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __update equations__ are as follows:\n",
    "![alt text](./updateequations2.png \"Update equations\")\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these update equations are in global coordinates. We have to transform them into vehicle coordinates where the car just moves along the x-direction. Thus, the update for the y-coordinate will be 0. Also the initial steering angle in car coordinates is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, this leads to the following updates:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align*}\n",
    "x & = v \\cdot dt \\\\\n",
    "y & = 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\psi &= - \\frac{v}{L_f} \\cdot \\delta \\cdot dt \\\\\n",
    "v & = v + a \\cdot dt \\\\\n",
    "cte & = cte + v \\cdot \\sin(e\\psi) \\cdot dt \\\\\n",
    "e\\psi & = e\\psi - \\frac{v}{L_f} \\cdot \\delta \\cdot dt\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision the car has to make in each time step is how to choose the actuators, i.e., where to steer and how fast to go. A cubic polynomial is fitted to the way points and a number $N$ of points is chosen equidistantly on this curve with time horizon $T = N \\cdot dt$. Now, we use the current state and the update equations to find values for the actuators that minimize a specific cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main parts of the cost function are the cross track error and the orientation error and we try to minimize both. We use an optimization tool (for nonlinear optimization) that is able to do this while also satisfying constraints (e.g., the update equations are provided via constraints). However, we add some regularization terms to the objective function in order to obtain a nicer driving experience. Therefore, we add the squared actuators and the squared difference of the actuators to obtain slow changes in the variables and smooth driving. I noted that the weighting factors for each part of the objective play a very important role for the car to stay on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up with the weight vector $[2000, 2000, 1, 1, 1, 10, 1]$ which penalizes the cte and the $e\\psi$ the most. The other parameters are chosen from experiments leading to factors that give a smooth driving experience that is also able to adapt to sharp turns. My reference speed was chosen to be 80."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When increasing the time horizon considered, common sense tells us that at some point there should not be much difference in the performance of our car (Do we really also need to consider the second next curve in order to have a good handling on the next curve?).\n",
    "\n",
    "For $dt$, I used the values $[0.05, 0.1, 0.2]$ and for $N$, I used the values $[10,20]$. However, I did not do extensive experiments here due to the lack of power of my computer. I ended up using $N = 10$ and $dt = 0.1$ which proved to be sufficient for the task."

    "### Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
